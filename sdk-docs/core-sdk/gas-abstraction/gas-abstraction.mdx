Every transaction we execute on a blockchain has a gas fee (transaction fee) that we have to pay in order for the transaction to be executed. Normally, all wallets pay gas fees with a chain's native token. However, with FunWallets, we can execute transactions with [ERC-20 tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) or even have the ability to completely abstract away gas payments.

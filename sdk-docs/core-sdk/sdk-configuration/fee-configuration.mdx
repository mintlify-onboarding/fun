title: "Fee configuration"
description: FunKit allows users to execute transactions on any EVM chain and provides a straightforward method of charging a developer fee on each transaction. This guide will describe an example and configuration options for these fees.
---

### Import required objects

We have to import `configureEnvironment` to set up the environment.

```java
import { configureEnvironment } from "@funkit/core";
```

### Configuring the FunWallet environment

The FunWallet environment is where we configure the developer fee. I’ll first explain the basic environment variables that we need to input:

1. `chain` \- Each FunWallet exists on an [EVM chain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/), and for this guide, we will be using the Goerli testnet.

2. `apiKey` \- We have provided a rate-limited `apiKey` used strictly for demoing purposes. Please visit our [dashboard](https://app.fun.xyz) to receive your own production `apiKey`.

```cs
configureEnvironment({
  chain: "goerli",
  apiKey: "ZrhepzWGxm74D0sqstuhT6dGrJxhoy8SZIToX6I3",
});
```

## Charging a fee

There are a couple of options FunWallet have for creating a developer fee. In the FunWallet environment, we can set up either a fixed fee or a percentage fee. Let me describe how to set it up.

### Charge a fixed fee

Let’s charge with a fixed fee of 0.001 ETH on each transaction. These are the parameters we will need to set up.

1. `token` \- This is where we select the token we want to charge a developer fee in. In our case, it will be ETH.

2. `amount` \- The amount that we want to charge a fee.

3. `recipient` \- This is where you choose to send the fee to, I’ve chosen a random address.

```cs
configureEnvironment({
  fee: {
    token: "eth",
    amount: 0.001,
    recipient: "0x2167F5F1F3570F17112E938d8C2237b2e412e075",
  },
});
```

The FunWallet needs to have the gas token to pay the fee, otherwise the transaction will fail. If the recipient address points to a contract that is unable to receive ETH via \`receive()\` or \`fallback()\` the transaction will fail.

### Charge a percentage fee

We also can use a percentage fee that takes current gas costs in mind. For example, we could set a 5% gas fee like this:

```cs
configureEnvironment({
  fee: {
    token: "eth",
    gasPercent: 5,
    recipient: "0x2167F5F1F3570F17112E938d8C2237b2e412e075",
  },
});
```

### Charge transaction volume fee

Charging a fixed fee and percentage fee are both determined in the FunWallet environment. However, we can also create transaction specific fees that can be customized with specific transaction parameters on a per transaction basis. See the summary for a full flow.

```cs
// Charge a 1% fee on each transaction based on volume
const transactionFee = transactionAmount * 0.01;

const txOptions = {
  fee: {
    token: "usdc",
    amount: transactionFee,
    recipient: DEVELOPER_ADDR,
  },
};
```

## Summary

### Environment Fees

Putting together all the pieces we can create a FunWallet environment that charges developers fees.

```java
import { configureEnvironment } from '@funkit/core'

configureEnvironment({
  chain: "goerli",
  apiKey: "ZrhepzWGxm74D0sqstuhT6dGrJxhoy8SZIToX6I3",
  fee: {
    token: "eth",
    gasPercent: 5,
    recipient: "0x2167F5F1F3570F17112E938d8C2237b2e412e075",
  },
})
```

### Transaction Volume Fee

Here's is a full flow of creating a transaction volume fee. I'll also recommend you check out the swap tokens guide for details on how to create the transaction.

```java
import { 
  FunWallet, 
  configureEnvironment, 
  Auth, 
  generatePrivateKey 
} from '@funkit/core'

const API_KEY = "ZrhepzWGxm74D0sqstuhT6dGrJxhoy8SZIToX6I3"
const PRIVATE_KEY = generatePrivateKey()
const DEVELOPER_ADDR = // ENTER YOUR ADDRESS HERE

const options = {
  chain: "base-mainnet",
  apiKey: API_KEY,
}

const swapMatic = async () => {
  await configureEnvironment(options)
  const auth = new Auth({ privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY })
  const userId = await auth.getAddress()
  const funWallet = new FunWallet({
    users: [{ userId: userId }],
    uniqueId: await auth.getWalletUniqueId(),
  })
  const assets = await funWallet.getAssets()
  const transactionAmount = 10.00
  const transactionFee = transactionAmount * 0.01
  const txOptions = {
    fee: {
      token: "usdc",
      amount: transactionFee,
      recipient: DEVELOPER_ADDR,
    }
  }
  const swapParams = {
    tokenIn: "usdc",
    inAmount: transactionAmount,
    tokenOut: "eth",
  }
  const swapOp = await funWallet.swap(auth, userId, swapParams, txOptions)
  const receipt = await funWallet.executeOperation(auth, swapOp)
  console.log(receipt)
}

// Call the swapMatic function to initiate the swap
swapMatic()
```

If the recipient addresses points to a contract that is unable to receive ETH via receive() or fallback(), the FunWallet transactions will be reverted.

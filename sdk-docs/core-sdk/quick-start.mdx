title: "Quick start"
description: "FunWallet is the core class of the FunKit SDK. It enables you to execute any transaction on an EVM chain and provides a straightforward method for implementing robust authentication schemes. In this quick start, I will show you how to create a FunWallet object using a private key. Along the way, I will explain the essential steps for configuring a FunWallet environment and describe the design decisions creating a FunWallet."

### 1\. Install FunKit

Use the Node Package Manager to install the FunKit SDK.

```bash
npm i @funkit/core --save
# or
yarn add @funkit/core
```

### 2\. Import required objects

We have to import three objects in order to create a FunWallet.

1. `FunWallet` to create the object.

2. `configureEnvironment` to setup the environment for a FunWallet.

3. `Auth` for authenticating into a FunWallet.

```
const { FunWallet, configureEnvironment, Auth } = require("@funkit/core");
```

### 3\. Configure the wallet environment

To begin, we need to set up the environment for your FunWallet. This is boilerplate code, but I will show you the process so that you can make adjustments in the future.

Let me explain the environment variables that we will need to input.

1. `chain` \- Each FunWallet exists on an [EVM-compatible blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/), and for this guide, we will be using the Goerli testnet.

2. `gasSponsor` – All wallets have to pay gas to execute transactions on a blockchain and FunWallets are no exception to that. But FunWallets also have the option of a gas sponsor that can cover the gas cost. For this guide, we will use a gasless sponsor that has been created for Goerli.

3. `apiKey` – We have provided a rate limited `apiKey` used strictly for demoing purposes.

```cs
await configureEnvironment({
  chain: "goerli",
  gasSponsor: {
    sponsorAddress: "0x175C5611402815Eba550Dad16abd2ac366a63329",
  },
  apiKey: "ZrhepzWGxm74D0sqstuhT6dGrJxhoy8SZIToX6I3",
});
```

Please visit our [dashboard](http://app.fun.xyz/) to create your own gasSponsor or to receive a production apiKey.

Please note that the use of a gasSponsor is tied to your apiKey .

### 4\. Initializing your FunWallet with an Auth object

With the `Auth` instance that we created in the step before, we are now able to initialize your FunWallet. Here are the FunWallet constructor parameters

1. `users` – This is an `User[]` that holds all users that can access your FunWallet. Since we’re only using 1 private key, our `User[]` only has 1 instance.

2. `uniqueId` – This is a random seed that is generated from our `Auth` instance. The purpose of this seed is to generate the `address` of our FunWallet.

```cs
const privateKey: string =
  "0x1bfda777ddaf097a791e98ea9bb8923f33f9a9e93c4ec3b0d8370de10782a825";
const auth = new Auth({ privateKey });

const funWallet = new FunWallet({
  users: [{ userId: auth.getAddress() }],
  uniqueId: auth.getWalletUniqueId(),
});
```

### 5\. Create FunWallet

The final step is to call `.create()`. This action will execute a transaction on the Goerli testnet (chain) to deploy your FunWallet.

```cs
funWallet.create(auth, userId);
```

## 6\. Summary

Putting together all the pieces we have `createWallet()` that you can use to create your FunWallet.

```cs
const { FunWallet, Auth, configureEnvironment, generatePrivateKey } = require('@funkit/core')

// Generate a private key for the wallet
const PRIVATE_KEY = generatePrivateKey()

const options = {
  chain: "goerli",
  gasSponsor: {
    sponsorAddress: "0x175C5611402815Eba550Dad16abd2ac366a63329"
  },
  apiKey: "ZrhepzWGxm74D0sqstuhT6dGrJxhoy8SZIToX6I3"
}

// Configure the environment with the specified options
configureEnvironment(options)

const createWallet = async () => {
  const auth = new Auth({ privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY })

  // Create a FunWallet instance for the user
  const funWallet = new FunWallet({
    users: [{ userId: await auth.getAddress() }],
    uniqueId: await auth.getWalletUniqueId()
  })

  // Use the authentication to create the wallet
  await funWallet.create(auth, await auth.getAddress())
}

// Call the function to create the wallet
createWallet()
```

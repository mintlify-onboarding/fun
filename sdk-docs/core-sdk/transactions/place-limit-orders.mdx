## Overview

[Limit orders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) lets you decide the price you want to swap a token at. With a Fun Wallet, you can create limit orders to ensure you receive the price you want for your trade. In this guide, I’ll show you how to set up a limit order. I will also assume some basic knowledge covered in the Quick Start but I’ll quickly walk through all the steps again.

#### Import required objects

```cs
import {
  FunWallet,
  Auth,
  configureEnvironment,
  generatePrivateKey,
} from "@funkit/core";
```

#### Configuring the Fun Wallet environment

To begin, we need to set up the environment for your Fun Wallet. We’ll be using the Goerli testnet and a gasless sponsor. Please visit our [dashboard](https://app.fun.xyz) to receive your own production `apiKey`.

```cs
await configureEnvironment({
  chain: "goerli",
  gasSponsor: {
    sponsorAddress: "0xCB5D0b4569A39C217c243a436AC3feEe5dFeb9Ad",
  },
  apiKey: "ZrhepzWGxm74D0sqstuhT6dGrJxhoy8SZIToX6I3",
});
```

Limit orders are not available on Base.

#### Creating Auth with a private key

We’ll use a private key as the authentication method and I’ll provide us with one.

```cs
const privateKey = generatePrivateKey();
const auth = new Auth({ privateKey });
```

#### Creating FunWallet with Auth

With the `Auth` instance that we created in the step before, we are now able to initialize and create your `FunWallet`.

```cs
const funWallet = new FunWallet({
  users: [{ userId: auth.getAddress() }],
  uniqueId: auth.getWalletUniqueId(),
});
```

## Creating a limit order

Now that we’ve created a Fun Wallet, we can set up a limit order. We’ll first set up the limit order parameters and I’ll give a quick definition of each parameter.

1. `tokenIn` \- This is the token that we have to sell.

2. `tokenOut` \- This is token that we want to buy.

3. `tokenInAmount` \- This is how much of `tokenIn` we want to sell.

4. `tokenOutAmount` \- This is how much of `tokenOut` we want to be able to buy with the `tokenIn` we’re selling.

Now let’s create a limit order. Suppose I have 1 ETH and I want to buy 1500 USDC with it, then I would fill out `limitParams` like this:

```cs
const limitParams = {
  tokenIn: "eth",
  tokenOut: "usdc",
  tokenInAmount: 1,
  tokenOutAmount: 1500,
};
```

Now that we have specific the parameters for a limit order. We can schedule the order and the order will fulfill at the correct market price.

```cs
const limitOp = await funWallet.limitSwapOrder(auth, userId, limitParams);
await funWallet.scheduleOperation(auth, limitOp);
```

## Summary

Putting together all the pieces we have `limitOrder()` that you can use to sell any token at your decided price.

```cs
import {
  FunWallet,
  Auth,
  configureEnvironment,
  generatePrivateKey
} from "@funkit/core"

const limitOrder = async () => {

  await configureEnvironment({
    chain: "goerli",
    gasSponsor: {
      sponsorAddress: "0xCB5D0b4569A39C217c243a436AC3feEe5dFeb9Ad"
    },
    apiKey: "ZrhepzWGxm74D0sqstuhT6dGrJxhoy8SZIToX6I3"
  })

  const privateKey = generatePrivateKey()
  const auth = new Auth({
    privateKey
  })

  const userId = await auth.getAddress();
  const funWallet = new FunWallet({
    users: [{
      userId: userId
    }],
    uniqueId: await auth.getWalletUniqueId(),
  })

  const limitParams = {
    tokenIn: "eth",
    tokenOut: "usdc",
    tokenInAmount: 1,
    tokenOutAmount: 1500,
  }

  const limitOp = await funWallet.limitSwapOrder(auth, userId, limitParams)
  const operationId = await funWallet.scheduleOperation(auth, limitOp)
  console.log(operationId)
}

limitOrder()
```
